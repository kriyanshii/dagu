# Runbook

Status: [[dag:${DOC_TEMPLATE_DAG_NAME}]]

## When to use

Describe the symptom that brings an operator here.

## Steps

1. Check the latest run and its logs.
2. Fix the underlying issue.
3. Re-run the workflow:

\`\`\`dagu-run
dag: ${DOC_TEMPLATE_DAG_NAME}
label: Re-run after fixing the issue
confirm: Starts a new run. Make sure the underlying issue is fixed first.
\`\`\`

> For actions needing sign-off, add an \`action: human.task\` step to the
> target DAG; the run then waits for approval before continuing.

## Escalation

Who to contact when the steps above do not resolve the issue.
