# Dagu

Dagu turns scripts and commands into reliable YAML workflows. It adds schedules, dependencies, retries, approvals, logs, and a Web UI in one open-source binary. You do not need an external database or message broker.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagucloud/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash
```

On Windows, run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagucloud/dagu/main/scripts/installer.ps1 | iex
```

The installers can add Dagu to `PATH`, set up a background service, and create the first admin account. See the [Windows installation guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/windows) for service and manual installation options.

Prefer Docker? Start the Web UI with the [official image](https://github.com/dagucloud/dagu/pkgs/container/dagu):

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v dagu-data:/var/lib/dagu ghcr.io/dagucloud/dagu:latest dagu start-all
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. The named volume keeps workflows, logs, history, and settings between runs. See the [Docker guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/docker) for Docker Compose, image tags, and host workflow mounts.

The native-install quickstart continues below. For Homebrew, npm, Kubernetes, and manual options, see [all installation methods](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/).

### 2. Run your first workflow

Save this as `hello.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: hello
    run: echo "Hello from Dagu!"
  - id: done
    run: echo "Workflow finished"
    depends: hello
```

Run it:

```sh
dagu start hello.yaml
```

### 3. Open the Web UI

Start the Web UI in the same directory:

```sh
dagu start-all --dags .
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> to see the run, step logs, and history. The [full quickstart](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/quickstart) also covers validation, expected output, and next steps.

Running Dagu as a persistent or shared service? Review [server configuration](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/configuration) and [authentication](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/authentication/) before exposing it beyond localhost.

If Dagu is useful, click **Star** at the top of this page. It helps other developers find the project.

## What Dagu gives you

- Keep your current scripts, commands, containers, and tools.
- Store readable workflow definitions in Git.
- Add dependencies, schedules, retries, timeouts, and approvals in YAML.
- Inspect live status, logs, and previous runs in the built-in Web UI.
- Start on one machine, then add queues or distributed workers if the workload grows.

## Why Dagu

Cron is easy to start but gives you little visibility once jobs depend on each other. Larger orchestrators solve that problem by adding services and a framework. Dagu keeps the operating model small:

```text
Traditional orchestrator              Dagu

Web server                            dagu start-all
Scheduler                             ├── Web UI
Workers                               ├── Scheduler
Database                              ├── Executor
Message broker                        └── Local file-backed state
Language runtime
```

The workflow calls the software you already use. It does not require you to move that code into a Dagu-specific framework.

## A practical workflow

This example runs a nightly report, retries the data step, and keeps the order explicit:

```yaml
schedule: "0 2 * * *"

steps:
  - id: extract
    run: python extract.py
    retry_policy:
      limit: 3
      interval_sec: 30

  - id: report
    run: ./build-report.sh
    depends: extract

  - id: archive
    run: tar -czf report.tgz report/
    depends: report
```

Dagu can also run containers, Kubernetes Jobs, SSH commands, SQL, HTTP requests, sub-workflows, human tasks, and reusable actions. Browse the [workflow examples](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/examples) or the [YAML reference](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/yaml-specification) when you need them.

## LLM-directed workflows

With `type: controller`, steps become a catalog and `tasks` state the goals; an LLM decides which step runs next until the goals are met:

```yaml
type: controller

secrets:
  - name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
    provider: env
    key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY

llm:
  provider: openrouter
  model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash

steps:
  - name: extract
    description: Pull the raw data.
    run: python extract.py
  - name: build-report
    description: Build the nightly report from the extracted data.
    run: ./build-report.sh
  - name: archive
    description: Archive the finished report.
    run: tar -czf report.tgz report/

tasks:
  - name: report-archived
    description: Finished when the nightly report is built and archived.
```

Also built in: `chat` steps run LLM calls with tool use inside any workflow.

See [Controller Workflows](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/controller).

## Operate Dagu from your AI tools

The direction also reverses: AI tools can run Dagu. The MCP endpoint (`http://localhost:8080/mcp`) lets MCP clients inspect workflows, start and control runs, and read results.

MCP Apps hosts can render run-related `dagu_read` and `dagu_execute` results in an interactive inspector with step status, scheduler and per-step logs, refresh, stop, retry, and a link to the full run page in Dagu. Other MCP clients continue to receive the same text and structured results.

For workflow-authoring help in Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other coding tools, install the Dagu skill:

```sh
gh skill install dagucloud/dagu dagu
```

See the [MCP guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/mcp/quickstart).

## Common uses

- Replace fragile cron chains while keeping the underlying scripts.
- Run ETL, reporting, backup, media, and infrastructure jobs.
- Coordinate Docker, Kubernetes, SSH, SQL, and HTTP work in one graph.
- Give operators a controlled way to run approved internal tasks.
- Keep automation close to data on servers, edge devices, or private networks.
- Distribute heavier workloads to workers selected by labels.

## Ways to run Dagu

| Model | Where Dagu runs | Good fit |
|---|---|---|
| Single server | One `dagu start-all` process | Development, scheduled jobs, and internal automation |
| Self-hosted workers | Server and workers on your infrastructure | Private networks, heavier workloads, and multiple execution hosts |
| Licensed self-hosted | Server and workers on your infrastructure, with a paid server license | Teams that need SSO, RBAC, audit logs, incident routing, additional API keys, and support; see [plans and pricing](https://dagu.sh/pricing#self-host) |

The same YAML works across these models. See [deployment models](https://docs.dagu.sh/overview/deployment-models) for the architecture, security boundaries, and setup details.
