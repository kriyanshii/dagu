# Spec: Controller DAGs

## Status

Implemented.

## Scope

This spec defines:

- the `type: controller` DAG shape
- the `tasks` root field and its role as the termination condition
- how declared steps become a catalog of actions offered to a model
- the decision loop, one action per turn
- the `set_task_status` and `ask_user` tools
- failure handling and action repetition
- suspension for human input and resumption
- terminal status derivation

This spec does not define:

- provider selection, model behavior, or prompt engineering beyond the framing
  the controller supplies
- `action: human.task` semantics, which are defined in `031-human-task.md`
- REST, Web UI, MCP, notification, authentication, or authorization behavior
- concurrent action execution

## Goal

A workflow author declares *what a run must achieve* rather than *the order in
which steps run*. Steps become capabilities; `tasks` become goals. A model
selects one action per turn, observes its outcome, and marks tasks complete
until every goal is satisfied, at which point the run concludes.

Because the controller drives the existing node machinery rather than an
in-process tool loop, an action may open a human task: the run releases its
process and worker slot, and the controller resumes with its conversation and
goal progress intact.

## DAG shape

```yaml
type: controller

llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-opus-5
  system: |
    Optional framing prepended to the controller's own instructions.

steps:
  - name: design
    action: dag.run
    with: { dag: design }

  - id: review
    name: review
    action: human.task
    with:
      prompt: Approve the design?

tasks:
  - name: designed
    description: Finished when the design workflow ran and a person approved it.
```

### Root fields

`tasks` is an array of objects with `name` and `description`. It is valid only
when `type` is `controller`, and `type: controller` requires it.

- `name` MUST be non-empty and unique within the DAG.
- `description` MUST be non-empty. It states the completion criteria the
  controller decides against, so an empty description is a specification error
  rather than a stylistic one.

`llm` MUST be present. Its `system` value, when set, is prepended to the
controller's own framing rather than replacing it.

`llm.system` and every task `description` are author-written prompt text and
MUST be resolved against the run's variables before the controller sees them, so
a workflow can be steered by its parameters without editing the DAG. The
resolved description is what gets persisted, since it is what the controller
judged against.

`llm.max_tool_iterations` bounds the number of decisions in a single run. When
unset the bound is 50.

### Step constraints

A controller DAG MUST declare at least one step. For every declared step:

- `depends` MUST NOT be set, and a step MUST NOT be explicitly marked as having
  no dependencies. Ordering belongs to the controller.
- `router` MUST NOT be set.
- The name `__controller__` is reserved and MUST NOT be used as a step name
  or ID.

Every declared step is implicitly failure-tolerant: a failed action never aborts
the run, because the failure is an observation the controller acts on.

### The controller step

Building a controller DAG appends a synthesized step named `__controller__`
carrying the DAG's `llm` configuration. It is the node the runner drives the
loop from, and it holds the conversation transcript, the tool catalog that was
offered, and the persisted goal progress. It is not an action the controller may
select.

## The action catalog

Each declared step is advertised to the model as one function-calling tool.

- The tool name derives from the step `id`, or the step `name` when no `id` is
  set. Characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` are replaced with `_`, the result is
  truncated to 64 characters, and collisions are disambiguated with a numeric
  suffix.
- The tool description is the step `description`; failing that, the human task
  prompt for a human task, the target workflow's description for `dag.run`, and
  otherwise a generated sentence naming the step.
- Only a step that launches a child DAG accepts arguments. Its schema is derived
  from the target's parameter definitions, falling back to its default-params
  string. Every other step is a nullary action.
- A parameter the step supplies a value for MUST NOT appear in that schema. A
  value written in the workflow is the author's decision, not one the controller
  restates, and a step that supplies every parameter is a nullary action.
- Parameters supplied by a child-DAG step MUST use named form. Positional
  parameters are rejected because tool arguments are identified by name.

The parameters a child DAG run receives are the ones the step supplies, plus an
argument for each parameter the step left open. An argument naming a parameter
the step supplies MUST be discarded rather than override it: the model was never
offered that choice.

Two additional tools are always offered.

`ask_user` puts a question to a person. A controller DAG is built with a
synthesized human task, named and identified `ask_user`, which the tool opens
with the question the controller wrote. Answering it is an ordinary human task
completion, and the reply returns as the next observation.

That task MUST NOT count as a declared human task when deciding whether the DAG
may run as somebody's child, or every controller would be barred from
composition. Instead the controller declines to ask when it is not the root run.

A question already answered MUST NOT be put to a person again: the answers so
far are restated to the controller each turn, an exact repeat is refused with the
prior answer, and a run may ask at most 5 questions.

`set_task_status` is always offered. It takes a `task`
name, a `status`, and a `reason`. It is reserved: no step tool may take that
name.

## The decision loop

Each turn:

1. The controller is sent a system message stating its role, the full task list
   with per-task completion status, and the operating rules, followed by the
   conversation so far.
2. The model replies. If it requests no tool call, see *Stalling* below.
3. Exactly one action is carried out per turn. When a reply contains several
   tool calls only the first is recorded and executed, so the conversation never
   references a result that was not produced.
4. The outcome is appended as the tool result: the resulting status, any error,
   and any human task submission.

   For a step that launched a child DAG, the rest of the observation is read
   from the child run itself: its status, the output variables its steps
   declared, and the name and error of any step that failed. The parent step's
   log MUST NOT be used as the source, because it only mirrors the child's
   status document, repeated once per internal retry, and is empty on a repeated
   run.

   For every other step, a bounded tail of stdout and stderr is reported.

The loop ends when no task is open, when an action opens a human task, or when a
limit is reached.

### Task status

Every task starts `open`. The controller settles it with `set_task_status`:

| Status | Meaning | Effect on the run |
|---|---|---|
| `completed` | The task's criteria are satisfied. | — |
| `skipped` | The task turned out to be unnecessary. | None: the run still succeeds. |
| `failed` | The task cannot be achieved. | The run fails. |
| `open` | Undo an earlier decision that later work invalidated. | Returns the task to the loop. |

`skipped` and `failed` MUST remain distinct: waiving a goal that never needed
doing is not the same outcome as failing to reach one.

Naming an unknown task, restating the status a task already holds, or passing a
status outside this set is reported back as a tool error and the loop continues;
none of these fail the run. The same applies to a call naming a tool that does
not exist, or arguments that cannot be decoded.

### Failure

A failed action is reported to the controller, which may retry it, choose a
different action, or stop. The failure is an observation, not a run-level error:
it MUST NOT by itself cause the run to report an error to its caller.

Final status follows the steps' end state. A failed action that was re-run
successfully leaves the run `succeeded`; an action left failed while every task
completed leaves it `partially succeeded`.

### Repetition

An action may be selected again after it has already run, which resets the node
and marks it repeated so a child DAG run receives a fresh run ID. A single
action may run at most 5 times per DAG run; beyond that, the request is refused
as a tool error and the controller must choose differently.

### Stalling

If the model replies without calling a tool while tasks remain open, it is
reminded once which tasks are outstanding. A second consecutive reply without a
tool call fails the run. Any turn that does use a tool clears the count, so
occasional silence between real work is not fatal.

### Limits

Reaching the turn limit with tasks still open fails the run, and the error names
the outstanding tasks. A task the controller cannot achieve should be settled as
`failed` rather than left open to exhaust the limit.

## Suspension and resumption

When a chosen action ends in the `waiting` status — an `action: human.task`
step, or a child DAG that is itself waiting — the controller records the
in-flight tool call, persists its state, and returns. The controller step itself
MUST NOT be left waiting, since an outstanding waiting step would prevent the
run from being released when the human task completes.

The run then reports `waiting`, the `onWait` handler runs, and the process
exits.

Completing the human task marks that step succeeded and re-queues the same DAG
run. On the next attempt the controller restores its transcript and goal
progress from the controller step, reports the outcome of the in-flight action
as that turn's tool result, and continues.

Restored state is reconciled against the current DAG: progress on a task that
still exists is preserved, a task that has been removed does not linger, and a
newly declared task starts open.

## Decision timeline

A controller run records an ordered timeline of its decisions, persisted
alongside goal progress and restored on resume. Each entry carries the turn it
belongs to and one of these kinds: `action`, `task_complete`, `task_reopen`,
`ask_user`, `rejected`, `stalled`. An `action` entry additionally carries the resulting
status, which attempt of that step it was, and the start and finish times.

The timeline exists because a controller has no dependency edges: execution
order is a property of the run, not of the DAG, and cannot be recovered from the
step list.

## Variable scope

A controller DAG has no dependency edges. Every action that has already
finished is treated as upstream of the action starting now, so its outputs are
in scope.

## Terminal status

- No task open and none failed, no action failed → `succeeded`. Skipped tasks do
  not change this.
- No task open and none failed, at least one action left failed →
  `partially succeeded`.
- Any task settled as `failed` → `failed`, and the error names those tasks with
  the reasons given.
- An action is waiting → `waiting`.
- Turn limit reached with open tasks, a second consecutive reply without a tool
  call, or an unrecoverable controller error → `failed`.

Steps the controller never selected are marked `skipped` when the run reaches a
terminal state.
