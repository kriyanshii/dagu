# Spec: XLSX Actions

## Status

Implemented.

Conformance covers writing and reading a workbook through the CLI: typing,
range and header options, table detection, limits, append, update_rows with
its shape checks, dry run, sheet preservation, type errors, validation
errors, the unsupported `.xls` format, the lock file, validate with every
problem kind and `on_problem: fail`, the human task that follows a
validation, write_cells into a workbook and into a copy, sheet operations
with their skip modes, convert to csv, json, and jsonl with Shift_JIS, a
Shift_JIS input file, and the `dagu dry` checks. Formula evaluation, merged
cells, named ranges, tables, custom number formats, the 1904 date system,
Windows sharing violations, and `wait_for_unlock` timing belong to unit
tests of `internal/cmn/workbook`.

## Scope

This spec defines the `xlsx.read`, `xlsx.info`, `xlsx.list_sheets`,
`xlsx.write`, `xlsx.append`, `xlsx.update_rows`, `xlsx.validate`,
`xlsx.write_cells`, `xlsx.sheet`, and `xlsx.convert` actions, the
`dagu xlsx inspect` and `dagu xlsx read` commands, the MCP `workbook` read
target, and the checks `dagu dry` runs for xlsx steps. It covers
configuration, validation, how cells become values, how values become
cells, published outputs, change summaries, atomic saves, and locked
workbooks.

Out of scope: driving a spreadsheet application, the `.xls` and `.ods`
formats, macros, charts, images, pivot tables, conditional formatting, the
workbook's own data validation rules, Google Sheets, file locking on synced
folders, and streaming writes for sheets beyond what memory holds. Charts,
images, and formatting the actions do not touch are preserved on save.

## Goal

A workflow can take a workbook as input, act on each row, and write results
back into the same workbook, without a spreadsheet application and without a
script, and a rerun is safe: rows already done are skipped and a sheet that
changed shape under the workflow is refused rather than written to.

## Behavior

### Operations

| Action | Purpose | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xlsx.read` | Rows of a sheet, range, named range, or table. | `rows`, `count`, `headers`, `sheet`, `range`, `warnings`, `truncated` |
| `xlsx.info` | Sheets with used range, detected table, headers, column types, row count, and tables; named ranges; date system. | `path`, `date_system`, `sheets`, `named_ranges`, `warnings` |
| `xlsx.list_sheets` | Sheet names in order. | `sheets`, `count` |
| `xlsx.write` | Create a workbook or write a sheet from rows. | `path`, `sheet`, `changes`, `dry_run`, `warnings`, `artifact` |
| `xlsx.append` | Add rows below the last used row. | Same as `xlsx.write` |
| `xlsx.update_rows` | Write columns back to rows selected by key or `_row`. | Same as `xlsx.write` |
| `xlsx.validate` | Check rows against rules and publish every problem. | `ok`, `problems`, `count`, `rows`, `headers`, `sheet`, `range`, `warnings`, `truncated` |
| `xlsx.write_cells` | Fill named cells of a workbook or of a copy. | Same as `xlsx.write` |
| `xlsx.sheet` | Add, copy, rename, or delete a sheet. | Same as `xlsx.write`, plus `sheets` |
| `xlsx.convert` | Export a sheet to csv, json, or jsonl. | `path`, `format`, `count`, `sheet`, `range`, `warnings`, `artifact` |

Outputs are fixed: declaring `output`, `outputs`, or `stdout.outputs` on an
xlsx step is rejected at validation. The executor writes one line to stdout
and one `warning:` line per warning to stderr; `xlsx.validate` also writes
one `problem:` line per problem.

Only `.xlsx` and `.xlsm` paths are accepted. `path` resolves like the file
actions: absolute and `~` paths as written, relative paths against the step
working directory. A `password` opens a protected workbook.

### Addressing

- `sheet` names the sheet; the first sheet by default. Names match exactly,
  then case-insensitively when that is unique. A miss lists the sheets present.
- `range` is `A2:F200`, `A2:F` or `A:F` (open end at the last used row), a
  single cell, `Sheet1!A2:F` or `'My Sheet'!A2:F` (the sheet in the range
  wins over `sheet`), a defined name (sheet scope preferred over workbook
  scope), or a table name.
- Without `range`, the data block is detected: leading empty rows and
  columns are skipped, the header is the first row with two or more non-empty
  cells, and the block extends to the last non-empty row and column. The
  `range` output reports the choice as `Sheet!A1:F120`.
- `header` is `true` (default: the first row of the range names the
  columns), `false` (columns are named `A`, `B`, `C`), a row number, or a
  list of row numbers whose cells are joined with a space, so `Amount` merged
  over `Net` and `Tax` yields `Amount Net` and `Amount Tax`. Header text is
  trimmed, line breaks become spaces, an empty header becomes the column
  letter with a warning, and a duplicate gets a `_2` suffix with a warning.
- `columns` keeps and orders columns: names, `Invoice No: invoice_no` to
  rename, or `{Invoice No: invoice_no}` entries. A name that matches no header
  fails the step listing the headers present.
- `merged` is `fill` (default: a merged value is read in every cell it
  covers) or `first` (only the top-left cell).

### Typing

| Cell | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Number | JSON number. Integral values within 2^53 are integers. |
| Number with a date, time, or date-time format | ISO 8601 text: `2026-10-01`, `15:04:05`, or `2026-10-01T14:30:00`. A serial with a fraction under a date-only format is a date-time. Built-in formats 14 to 22, 27 to 36, 45 to 47, and 50 to 58 count, and so does a custom format with date or time tokens outside quotes, such as `yyyy"年"m"月"d"日"`. `[h]:mm` counts elapsed time and stays a number. The 1900 and 1904 date systems are honored. |
| Text, including text-formatted numbers | String, so leading zeros survive. `trim: true` removes surrounding white space, including the full-width space U+3000. |
| Boolean | `true` or `false`. |
| Formula | Its cached value. `formulas: text` yields `=` and the formula; `formulas: calculate` evaluates it. A formula without a cached value is evaluated with a warning; one that cannot be evaluated is null with a warning. |
| Error such as `#N/A` | Null, with a warning naming the cell. |
| Empty | Null. Trailing rows whose cells are all null are dropped unless `keep_empty_rows: true`. |

Each row carries `_row`, its 1-based sheet row number. `types` pins columns
to `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date`, or `datetime`; a cell
that cannot convert fails the step naming the cell, or with
`on_type_error: warn` (also spelled `null`) becomes null with a warning.

### Reading

`where` keeps rows: a scalar matches equal values, `""` matches empty
cells, `{ne: v}` excludes a value, `{in: [a, b]}` matches a list. Numbers
compare numerically and everything else as trimmed text. Keys may use the
original header, a loose match, or a `columns` alias.

`stop_at_blank: true` stops at the first row whose resolved values are all
null. `max_rows` (default 5000) counts rows that hold a value; blank rows
between them are kept as null rows without counting, unless
`keep_empty_rows` is set, in which case every row counts. Reaching the cap
stops reading; `truncated` is set, with a warning, only when more countable
rows remain below the cap, so a sheet holding exactly `max_rows` rows is not
truncated. Rows that exceed the step output budget, 900 KiB or
`max_output_size` less 64 KiB, are left out from the end and `truncated` is
true with a warning.

### Writing

`xlsx.write` takes `rows` or `input`, not both. `rows` is a list of objects
or arrays, usually `${steps.<id>.outputs.rows}`; the key order of JSON text
is kept, while objects from YAML or a decoded map are written in sorted key
order unless `columns` orders them. `input` is a `.json` array, a `.jsonl`
file, or a `.csv` with a header line; `format` overrides the extension. A
`_row` field is never written.

A missing workbook is created. A `sheet` that does not exist is created; an
existing sheet is replaced (`mode: replace`, the default) or extended
(`mode: append`). A replaced sheet is cleared in place: its merged regions
and tables are removed, and every cell holding a value or formula is
emptied of its value, style, and hyperlink. Cells that carry only a style
are cleared as well when the sheet's stored dimension spans at most 2^20
cells; past that, a sweep of the whole rectangle is skipped so a large
sparse sheet stays cheap to replace, and such style-only cells keep their
style. A hyperlink on a cell the clear does not visit, one that is empty
and outside both the stored dimension and the cells holding values, is
kept for the same reason. The sheet itself, its position, the defined names scoped to it, and
formulas on other sheets that refer to it stay valid. Other sheets, column
widths, styles, and defined names are untouched. An AutoFilter on the
replaced sheet stays in place, as the underlying library offers no way to
remove one.

Values are written by type: numbers as numbers, booleans as booleans,
`2026-10-01` and `2026-10-01T14:30:00` strings as dates, other strings as
text. `types` pins a column: `number` and `date` convert strings, `string`
keeps ISO-looking text as text.

`style: table` (default) makes a new or replaced sheet look finished: bold
header on a light fill, frozen below the header, column widths fitted to
content between 8 and 60 characters with East Asian characters counting
double, and number formats by column kind: integers plain, decimals with two
places, dates `yyyy-mm-dd`, date-times `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`, text `@`. A
column mixing dates and date-times is formatted as date-time. `style: none`
writes bare cells.

`xlsx.append`, and `mode: append`, write below the last non-empty row with
no header, and each new cell copies the style of the cell above it, so a date
column stays a date column. An append that starts an empty sheet writes the
header so the first run creates a table.

### Updating rows

`xlsx.update_rows` takes `rows` (objects, each with the `key` column and
optionally `_row`), `key` (a column name, or `_row` to address rows by
number alone), and `set`:

```yaml
set:
  Status: status            # a field of each row
  Reviewed: {value: "yes"}  # one literal for every row
```

Without `set`, every field other than the key and `_row` goes to the
column of the same name. A field in `set` that no row carries is an error. A
column that is not in the header row is added at the right, its header cell
copying the style of the last header cell.

Rows are matched by `_row` when present, else by the key column, with keys
compared as trimmed text so `7` and `"7"` match. A key found at two rows is an
error. A key not found does what `missing` says: `fail` (default), `skip`
with a warning, or `append` below the last used row, copying the styles of
the row above. With `key: _row`, `missing` must be `fail`.

`rows` may also be the aggregate output of a `foreach` step, an object with
`summary`, `items`, and `outputs`; its `outputs` list, the collected objects
of the item bodies that succeeded, is used. Two input rows that address the
same sheet row are an error.

Only the columns in `set` change. A row that does not carry a mapped field
leaves that cell as it is; an explicit null empties it. A cell whose value
already matches, compared with its type so the number 7 and the text `7`
differ, is not counted as changed. A date written into a date column keeps
the column's format; a date written elsewhere gets a date format. The key
column cannot be in `set`.

### Shape checks

Two checks run before any cell is written, and either failure aborts the
step with the workbook untouched. They cannot be turned off.

1. The key column and every column in `set` that already exists must still be
   in the header row by exact name. A header that matches only
   case-insensitively or after trimming is reported with the name found.
2. Every row carrying `_row` must still hold its key at that row.

### Change summary

Every writer publishes `changes`:

```json
{"sheet": "Orders", "range": "Orders!A2:F148", "rows_updated": 147,
 "rows_appended": 0, "columns_added": 1, "cells_changed": 294}
```

`dry_run: true` computes the same summary and saves nothing.

### Atomic save and locks

A save writes a short-named temporary file beside the workbook, gives it the
target's permission bits, and renames it over the target, so a crash never
leaves a half-written workbook; a symbolic link is followed so the workbook
it points to is replaced. `atomic: false` saves in place. Excel's
`~$name.xlsx` lock file is checked before a write: a lock file another
process still holds open, which on Windows means Excel has the workbook,
fails the step; a lock file nobody holds is a leftover of a crash, so the
step warns and continues. A Windows sharing violation on open, save, or
rename fails the same way. `wait_for_unlock: 5m` retries a locked workbook,
waiting two seconds and doubling to one minute, and logs each wait; the
whole open-modify-save sequence runs again on each try.

### Artifacts

`artifact: true` on a writer copies the saved workbook under
`xlsx/<step>/` in the run's artifacts directory and publishes its relative
path as `artifact`. The option enables artifact storage for the DAG, as
does a value reference such as `${params.KEEP}` whose value is only known
at run time. A dry run copies nothing. A copy that fails after the workbook
was saved is reported as a warning, not as a failed step, so a retry does
not repeat a write that already happened.

### CLI

`dagu xlsx inspect <path> [--rows N] [--sheet NAME] [--format text|json]`
prints what `xlsx.info` publishes plus up to N typed sample rows per sheet.
`dagu xlsx read <path> [--sheet] [--range] [--header] [--columns]
[--max-rows] [--format]` prints what `xlsx.read` publishes. Both read the
file directly, create no run, and exit non-zero with the error on stderr.

### MCP

The `dagu_read` target `workbook` takes `path`, any workbook the server
process can read, and returns the `inspect` description with five sample
rows per sheet. The path is recorded in the audit log as `workbook_path`.
Spec 021 defines the target's fields and errors.

### Validating

`xlsx.validate` reads a sheet the way `xlsx.read` does (`sheet`, `range`,
`header`, `columns`, `merged`, `trim`, `formulas`) and checks every
non-empty row against rules: `required` lists columns the header row must
have, `not_blank` columns no row may leave empty, `unique` columns whose
values may not repeat, `types` columns whose cells must convert, and
`allowed` the values a column's cells may hold. Names in the rules match a
header exactly, loosely (ignoring case and surrounding space), or through a
`columns` alias. `unique` and `allowed` skip empty cells; `not_blank` is
the rule for those. At least one rule is required.

Every failed check is one problem with a `code`, the `sheet`, the `cell`
and `row` (absent for a missing column), the `column` as the header reads,
and a `message`:

| Code | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_column` | A rule names a column the header row does not have; that rule is skipped. |
| `blank` | A `not_blank` column is empty: `Status is blank`. |
| `type` | A cell cannot convert to its column's type: `expected number, found "N/A"`. |
| `duplicate` | A `unique` value seen before: `duplicate value "INV-1"; first at row 5`. |
| `not_allowed` | A value outside the allowed list: `value "Pending" is not one of Done, Open`. |

`count` is every problem found, `rows` the non-empty rows checked, and `ok`
is true when `count` is zero. `problems` keeps at most `max_problems`
(default 1000) and is fitted to the output budget like `rows`; `truncated`
says when either cut it. Each problem also goes to stderr as
`problem: Sheet!Cell: message`, or `problem: Sheet: message` for a missing
column, which has no cell.

With `on_problem: warn`, the default, the step succeeds with the problems
published. With `on_problem: fail` the step fails after listing them, with
`N problems found in <workbook> <sheet>`; a failed step publishes no
outputs (Spec 012), so a workflow that must act on the problems keeps the
default.

To stop and ask someone when a workbook has problems, follow the
validation with a `human.task` step whose precondition is the count, and
let the rest of the workflow continue past a skipped task:

```yaml
  - id: check
    action: xlsx.validate
    with:
      path: orders.xlsx
      required: [Invoice No, Amount]
      allowed: {Status: [Open, Done]}
  - id: review
    depends: check
    action: human.task
    preconditions:
      - condition: "${steps.check.outputs.count}"
        expected: "num:>0"
    continue_on:
      skipped: true
    with:
      prompt: Fix the problems in orders.xlsx and continue
```

With no problems the task is skipped and the run goes on; with problems
the run waits for the task to be completed (Spec 031) and continues from
there.

### Writing cells

`xlsx.write_cells` fills named cells of an existing workbook, the way a
template is filled. `cells` maps addresses to what they receive: a cell
such as `B2`, `Sheet1!B2`, or `'My Sheet'!B2`, or a defined name that
refers to one cell; an address without a sheet uses `sheet`, the first
sheet by default. A range, a named range, or a table is refused with
`"A1:B2" is not a single cell`, and two addresses that name the same cell,
such as `B3` and `$B$3`, with `"B3" and "$B$3" name the same cell Sheet1!B3`.
A value is written as a cell value, with an
ISO date or date-time string becoming a date; `{value: v, type: t}` pins
the type, so `{value: "007", type: string}` stays text; `{formula: text}`
writes a formula, with or without a leading `=`; `null` empties the cell
and removes its formula. Every cell keeps its style, and a date written
into a cell with no date format gains one. A cell that already holds the
value, or the formula, is not a change; text and a date that read the
same, such as the text `2026-10-01` and that date, are told apart by what
the cell stores, so a date written over text is a change.

The workbook must exist: a template fill needs a template, and `xlsx.write`
creates workbooks. With `output`, the result is written there and the
workbook at `path` is left as it was, so one template serves many fills;
`output` must be a different file from `path`, a hard link included;
the output path takes the saved file's place in `path` and `artifact`.
`changes` reports `cells_changed`, `rows_updated` as the distinct rows a
changed cell was on, and `sheet` and `range` as the default sheet and the
bounding box of the cells changed on it. `dry_run`, `atomic`,
`wait_for_unlock`, and `artifact` apply as for `xlsx.write`.

### Sheets

`xlsx.sheet` runs one `operation` on a workbook that must exist: `add`
creates the sheet named `sheet`; `copy` duplicates `sheet` as `to`;
`rename` gives `sheet` the name `to`; `delete` removes `sheet`. `position`
places a sheet `add` or `copy` creates, 1-based; by default an added sheet
goes last and a copy right after its source.

A rerun must be safe, so the modes say what happens when the workbook is
not as expected. `if_exists` applies to the sheet `add`, `copy`, and
`rename` would create: `fail` (default) with `sheet "October" already
exists`, `skip` with a warning and nothing changed, or `replace`, which
empties an added sheet in place, copies over the existing sheet keeping its
position, or drops the sheet in a rename's way. `missing` applies to the
sheet `copy`, `rename`, and `delete` start from: `fail` (default) or `skip`
with a warning. Deleting the only sheet fails with `cannot delete the only
sheet "Sheet1"`. A rename to the same name, or one that only changes case,
is accepted.

The outputs are those of a writer plus `sheets`, the sheet names
afterwards; `sheet` is the sheet the operation produced or removed. The
underlying library sets three limits, stated here so a workflow can plan
for them: a rename does not rewrite formulas on other sheets that name the
sheet, though defined names follow it; a delete leaves such references
dangling and drops the names scoped to the sheet; and a copy carries
cells, styles, widths, merged regions, and validations but not tables,
images, charts, or page setup.

### Converting

`xlsx.convert` writes the rows of a sheet to the file named by `output`,
as `csv`, `json`, or `jsonl` by the file's extension (`.ndjson` counts as
jsonl) or by `format`. It reads the way `xlsx.read` does (`sheet`,
`range`, `header`, `columns`, `types`, `trim`, `merged`, `formulas`) but
with every row and no output budget, since the rows go to a file, and a
cell that fails a pinned type fails the step. Columns follow the header
order, or `columns`, and the `_row` field is not written: the file is a
table. CSV cells are text as a reader would show them, with dates in ISO
form and booleans as `true` and `false`; JSON keeps the typed values. The
file is written through a temporary file in its directory and renamed into
place unless `atomic: false`.

CSV takes `encoding`: `utf-8` (default, no byte order mark), `utf-8-bom`
for Excel to open the file as UTF-8 by double click, or `shift_jis` as
Windows uses it (code page 932, Windows-31J; `cp932`, `windows-31j`,
`sjis`, and `ms932` are accepted spellings), and `delimiter`, one
character, a comma by default. The outputs are `path`, `format`, `count`,
`sheet`, `range`, `warnings`, and with `artifact: true` the file's copy.
The other direction, a csv, json, or jsonl file into a workbook, is
`xlsx.write` with `input`.

### Input encoding

The `input` file of `xlsx.write` and `xlsx.append` takes the same
`encoding` and `delimiter` when it is csv; a byte order mark is dropped
either way. Both fields require `input`.

### Dry-run checks

`dagu dry` (Spec 064) runs a check for every xlsx step and warns, without
failing, when the step would fail on this host: the workbook of a reading
or updating operation, of `write_cells`, or of a `sheet` operation other
than `add` does not exist; the `sheet` named is not in it; a column named
in `columns`, `types`, `where`, or a validation rule is not in the header
row, where a `where` key or a rule name may be an alias given in `columns`
while the `types` of a read or convert name headers, as the run requires;
the key or a `set` column of `update_rows` is not in the header row
as written; or the `input` file of `write` or `append` does not exist. The
warning names the field, as `field 'with.sheet': orders.xlsx: sheet "Nope"
not found; sheets present: Orders`, and lists every problem found. A field
whose value still holds a reference to a step output is skipped, since no
step has run; params and environment resolve. A workbook the check cannot
open, such as one another program holds, is left to the run.

## Errors

### Validation

Every one of these is rejected by `dagu validate`:

- Any xlsx action without `with.path`: `path is required for <operation>`.
- `xlsx.write` or `xlsx.append` without `rows` or `input`:
  `write requires with.rows or with.input`; with both:
  `accepts with.rows or with.input, not both`.
- `xlsx.update_rows` without `key`: `key is required for update_rows`;
  without `rows`: `update_rows requires with.rows`.
- A field of another operation, such as `range` on `xlsx.info`:
  `with.range is not valid for xlsx.info`.
- An unknown field, or a value outside its enum (`merged`, `formulas`,
  `on_type_error`, `mode`, `style`, `format`, `missing`, a type in `types`).
- `output`, `outputs`, or `stdout.outputs` on an xlsx step:
  `xlsx actions have fixed outputs`.
- `header` that is not `true`, `false`, a row number, or a list of row
  numbers; `max_rows` below 1; a `where` operator other than `eq`, `ne`, or
  `in`; `set` values that are neither a field name nor `{value: literal}`;
  `missing: skip` or `append` with `key: _row`; `wait_for_unlock` that is
  not a duration.
- `xlsx.validate` with no rule: `validate requires at least one of
  with.required, with.not_blank, with.unique, with.types, or with.allowed`;
  `on_problem` outside `warn` and `fail`: `on_problem must be warn or fail`;
  `max_problems` below 1; an `allowed` value that is not a list:
  `allowed.Status must be a list of values`.
- `xlsx.write_cells` without `cells`: `write_cells requires with.cells`;
  empty `cells`: `cells must not be empty`; a cell value of another shape:
  `cells.B2: use a scalar, null, {value: v, type: t}, or {formula: text}`;
  an empty formula: `cells.B2: formula must not be empty`; an `output`
  that is not a workbook: `output: out.csv: only .xlsx and .xlsm workbooks
  are supported; save as .xlsx`.
- `xlsx.sheet` without `operation` or `sheet`: `operation is required for
  sheet`, `sheet is required for sheet`; an `operation` outside the four;
  `copy` or `rename` without `to`: `to is required for copy`; `to`,
  `if_exists`, `missing`, or `position` on an operation that does not take
  it: `to is only valid for copy and rename`, `if_exists is only valid for
  add, copy, and rename`, `missing is only valid for copy, rename, and
  delete`, `position is only valid for add and copy`; `position` below 1.
- `xlsx.convert` without `output`: `convert requires with.output`; an
  output whose extension names no format and no `format`: `output
  extension ".txt" is not json, jsonl, or csv; set format`; `encoding` or
  `delimiter` with a format other than csv: `encoding applies to csv only`.
- `encoding` outside `utf-8`, `utf-8-bom`, and `shift_jis` and its
  spellings: `encoding must be utf-8, utf-8-bom, or shift_jis`; a
  `delimiter` that is not one character: `delimiter must be a single
  character`; either on `xlsx.write` or `xlsx.append` without `input`:
  `encoding requires with.input`.

### Runtime

- A path that is not `.xlsx` or `.xlsm`: an error containing
  `only .xlsx and .xlsm workbooks are supported; save as .xlsx`.
- A missing workbook: `<name>: workbook not found`.
- A missing sheet: `sheet "Order" not found; sheets present: Orders, Summary`.
- A range that is none of the accepted forms:
  `range "Totals" is not a cell range, named range, or table`.
- A `columns`, `types`, or `where` name that matches no header:
  `column "Nope" not found; headers present: ...`.
- A cell that fails a pinned type:
  `orders.xlsx Orders!D17: expected number, found "N/A"`.
- A key column missing from the header row:
  `key column "Invoice" not found in header row 1; headers present: ...`, or
  with a loose match, `did you mean "Invoice No"?`.
- A `set` column with only a loose match:
  `column "status" not found in header row 1; did you mean "Status"?`.
- A row that moved: `orders.xlsx Orders!A17: expected key "INV-17", found
  "INV-18"; the sheet changed since it was read`.
- A key not in the sheet with `missing: fail`: `key "INV-99" not found`.
- A key at two rows: `key "INV-1" appears at rows 5 and 9`.
- A workbook another program holds, on Windows:
  `orders.xlsx is open in another program; close it and retry`.
- `artifact: true` in a DAG whose artifacts are disabled:
  `artifact requires artifact storage`.
- `xlsx.validate` with `on_problem: fail` and any problem:
  `2 problems found in orders.xlsx Orders`.
- A `write_cells` address that is not one cell: `template.xlsx: "A1:B2" is
  not a single cell`; a workbook to fill that does not exist:
  `template.xlsx: workbook not found`.
- A sheet to create that exists, with `if_exists: fail`:
  `report.xlsx: sheet "October" already exists`; a copy onto its own
  source: `sheet "Template" cannot be copied onto itself`; a `position`
  past the end: `position 5 is outside 1 to 4`; deleting the last sheet:
  `report.xlsx: cannot delete the only sheet "Sheet1"`; a name Excel
  refuses: `invalid sheet name "Bad:Name"`.
- A `convert` output that cannot be written, such as into a directory that
  does not exist: `out.csv: <system error>`.

Errors that concern a cell name the workbook, sheet, and cell as
`<workbook> <sheet>!<cell>: <message>`.

## Examples

Read rows still to do, act on each, and write the result back:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: read
    action: xlsx.read
    with:
      path: ~/Inbox/orders.xlsx
      sheet: Orders
      where: {Status: ""}
  - id: each
    depends: read
    foreach:
      items: ${steps.read.outputs.rows}
      key: ${foreach.item.order_id}
      steps:
        - id: submit
          action: http.request
          with:
            method: POST
            url: https://erp.example.com/orders
            body: ${foreach.item}
            format: json
      collect:
        order_id: ${foreach.item.order_id}
        status: ${steps.submit.outputs.status_code}
    output: RESULTS
    continue_on:
      failure: true
  - id: mark
    depends: each
    action: xlsx.update_rows
    with:
      path: ~/Inbox/orders.xlsx
      sheet: Orders
      key: order_id
      rows: ${steps.each.outputs.RESULTS}
      set:
        Status: status
      wait_for_unlock: 5m
```

`collect` gives each successful item one object with the key and the result
fields, and `rows` takes the foreach aggregate directly, using its `outputs`
list. `continue_on.failure` on the loop lets the write-back run when some
rows failed, so the rows that succeeded are marked rather than submitted
again on the next run.

Build a report from a query and keep it with the run:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: totals
    action: postgres.query
    with:
      dsn: ${env.REPORTING_DSN}
      query: select customer, sum(amount) as total from orders group by customer
  - id: report
    depends: totals
    action: xlsx.write
    with:
      path: reports/${context.attempt.started_at}.xlsx
      sheet: Totals
      rows: ${steps.totals.outputs.rows}
      columns: [customer, total]
      types: {total: number}
      artifact: true
```

Preview what an append would change, then do it:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: preview
    action: xlsx.append
    with:
      path: log.xlsx
      rows: ${params.ROWS}
      dry_run: true
  - id: append
    depends: preview
    action: xlsx.append
    with:
      path: log.xlsx
      rows: ${params.ROWS}
```

Fill an invoice template for each order and keep the copies with the run:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: orders
    action: xlsx.read
    with:
      path: orders.xlsx
      columns: [{Invoice No: invoice}, {Customer: customer}, {Amount: amount}]
  - id: each
    depends: orders
    foreach: ${steps.orders.outputs.rows}
    steps:
      - id: fill
        action: xlsx.write_cells
        with:
          path: templates/invoice.xlsx
          output: out/invoice-${item.invoice}.xlsx
          cells:
            Customer: ${item.customer}
            B7: ${item.amount}
            B9: {formula: "=B7*1.1"}
          artifact: true
```

Start a new month from the template sheet, safe to rerun:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: query
    action: postgres.query
    with:
      dsn: ${env.REPORTING_DSN}
      query: select item, amount from expenses where month = '${params.MONTH}'
  - id: month
    action: xlsx.sheet
    with:
      path: report.xlsx
      operation: copy
      sheet: Template
      to: ${params.MONTH}
      if_exists: skip
  - id: fill
    depends: [query, month]
    action: xlsx.write
    with:
      path: report.xlsx
      sheet: ${params.MONTH}
      mode: append
      rows: ${steps.query.outputs.rows}
```

Export a sheet for a system that reads Shift_JIS CSV:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: export
    action: xlsx.convert
    with:
      path: orders.xlsx
      sheet: Orders
      output: out/orders.csv
      encoding: shift_jis
      columns: [品名, 数量, 金額]
```
